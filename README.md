# Quant Strategy Lab

**A Decision Science Portfolio by Dr Siddharth Kulkarni**

> *“Where probabilistic modelling meets strategic impact.”*

---

## 🚀 Overview

This is a portfolio of 10 advanced quantitative strategy models designed for high-stakes decision-making in business. Each model blends probabilistic calculus, Bayesian inference, and stochastic simulation to solve core business challenges—delivering actionable, executive-level insights.

## 🧠 Why This Portfolio?

This portfolio is a personal exploration of how probabilistic thinking can be applied to real-world business questions. I enjoy experimenting with mathematical models, simulations, and decision frameworks.

- **Curiosity-Driven** — each model starts with a question I find interesting  
- **Probabilistic Thinking** — exploring uncertainty, not just solving for averages  
- **Sharable Ideas** — open code and notebooks for anyone who wants to explore along  

## 📂 Portfolio Contents
Each folder contains:

- **Business Case Notebook** — problem framing, model, simulation, decision insight  
- **Python Model Code** — reusable module for integration  
- **Visuals** — annotated, executive-ready charts  

### Models Included

1. Brand ROI Optimization (Exponential & Budget Constraint)  
2. Trust Decay Model (Exponential Decay & Crisis Response)  
3. Bayesian Campaign Update (Posterior Decision Thresholds)  
4. Customer LTV Decomposition (Probabilistic LTV)  
5. Stochastic Churn Forecasting (Ito Process)  
6. Segmentation via Bayesian Clustering  
7. Scenario Stress Testing (Monte Carlo Shocks)  
8. Time Lag & Impact Analysis (Causal Lag Modeling)  
9. Marginal Inflection Analysis (Optimal Stops)  
10. Strategic Decision Overlay (Full Model Stack)  

## 🎓 About Me
